## Beliefs

* _A notebook isn't enough_ - A data science notebook is where experimentation starts, but you can't create a reproducible, collaborative ML project with just a `*.ipynb` file.
* _Reproducible, collaborative projects is a solved problem for classical software_ - We don't need to re-invent the wheel for machine learning projects. Instead, we need guide rails to help data scientists structure projects without forcing them to also become software engineers.
* _Python already has a good package manager_ - We don't need overly abstracted solutions to package a trained ML model. A properly structured ML project makes it easy to use _pip_ for packaging a model, making it easy for _anyone_ to benefit from your work.
* _Version control is a requirement_ - You can't have a reproducible project if the code and training data isn't in version control.
* _Docker is a heavyweight solution for solving reproducibility_ -
